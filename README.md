# Welcome to my profile

## About me

I am a 27 year old writer from the DFW area in Texas. I am currently using Github to document **Project Shark**: my journey in learning cyber security. 

I want to learn cyber security because I believe that it is important to understand how to protect one's digital presence and identity. Much of our lives is now spent online or on some kind of device, so having an understanding of these concepts is more important than ever. 

Other interests I have include reading, cycling, playing and listening to music, and learning new things. 

## Check out my newsletter

I also have a newsletter that I add to semi-regularly, called [I Only Know That I Know Nothing](https://ioktikn.substack.com).

In the newsletter you'll find mostly essays and short stories on a variety of topics and genres. It's mostly just a place for me to express my thoughts in the form of articles that I hope for people to find entertaining, intriguing, and hopefully inspiring. 

## Support my work

I also have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/noahievalk) page where you can send donations to support my work if you'd like. Any donation would be greatly appreciated. 

## Reach out!
